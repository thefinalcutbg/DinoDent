## General Information

The project is not finished yet and lacks lots of features. However it already has integration with NHIF and NRA, so submitting monthly reports and invoices and performing different register checks are working.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the many bulgarian dental softwares - so clumsy to use, that have gotten me to the point of learning how to code and writing my own software for the needs of my dental practice.
