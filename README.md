## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the many builgarian dental softwares - so clumsy to use, that have gotten me to the point of learning how to code and writing my own software for the needs of my dental practice.
- Special thanks to Lachezar Kozhuharov, Konstantin Shegunov, Hasan Hasanov and all other real programmers, who have always been there to answer my stupid questions
