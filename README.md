## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the many bulgarian dental softwares - so clumsy to use, that have gotten me to the point of learning how to code and writing my own software for the needs of my dental practice.
- Special thanks to [@LachezarKozhuharov](https://github.com/LachezarKozhuharov), [@kshegunov](https://github.com/kshegunov), [@hasan-hasanov](https://github.com/hasan-hasanov) and all other real programmers, who have always been there to answer my stupid questions.
